11,"This year included several firsts for BTS, making them big moments for the group. As the year comes to an end, we take you on a brief journey on the major achievements and big moments of BTS this year. The year started with several BTS members facing health issues when they contracted Covid-19. Jin and Jimin even underwent finger and appendix surgeries, respectively, ahead of their concert in Seoul, their first on the home ground after over two years. Here's a recap of the big moments of BTS in 2022-- 1) Concerts in Seoul, Las Vegas, Busan: BTS’ Permission to Dance On Stage--Seoul concert was held in March. It was significant as it was the first time BTS had a concert with an in-person audience in the city in two and a half years. BTS next held their Permission to Dance On Stage concert in Las Vegas in April. The first concert came just days ahead of their performance at the Grammys. BTS also held its first free concert in Busan in October. For this show, BTS appeared 'without any additional fee' and HYBE invested their personal funds for the concert. 2) BTS members at Grammy's: The seven members performed at the 64th Grammy Awards in April, their first in-person performance for which they received a standing ovation. Just ahead of the show, BTS members contracted Covid-19 and Jin could partially perform due to his surgery. The performance saw the members pulling off a museum heist on their single Butter. 3) BTS 'on a break': Fans were left shocked and heartbroken when during the Festa dinner the group announced a 'hiatus'. Suga had said in a video during the dinner as per the English subtitles, “So we’ve entered an off-season. We’re going into a hiatus now.” He later added, “It’s not like we’re disbanding. We should live doing what we want to do...Writing lyrics is the hardest. What message do we want to give? Nothing comes out anymore."" Later, AP quoted BigHit's clarification, “BTS are not taking a hiatus. Members will be focusing more on solo projects at this time."" RM and Jungkook also issued clarifications that they will not go on a hiatus. 4) BTS album Proof: The group released their anthology album Proof in June. The album is a 3-CD collection of BTS’ hit old as well as new songs. Proof included three new songs--Yet to Come, Run BTS, and Born Singer. Their old hits I Need You, Run, Fire, Fake Love, Persona, Moon, are also part of the album. It released a few days before their ninth debut anniversary, on June 10. 5) BTS at the White House: The group attended the White House Press briefing in May to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes. They made history as they had a private meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House for the first time ever. They were invited to the White House in celebration of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders Heritage Month (AANHPI Heritage Month). The US President surprised the members by playing Butter in the Oval Office before their discussion to make them 'feel at home'. 6) BTS military enlistment: South Korea has a rule of mandatory military service for able-bodied men by 28. K-pop stars are granted the ability to defer their enrolment until 30. BTS ARMY has always dreaded the time when the members will have to spend months in the military. This year, in October, BigHit Music announced that military enlistment will begin with the eldest member Jin. All the other members--RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V aka Kim Taehyung and Jungkook will follow him. The group will reconvene in 2025. Though fans wished them well, the news left them emotional. Apart from these, BTS also made a comeback with their variety show, RUN BTS, after 10 months. Fans saw the members doing solo projects with Jimin singing With You for K-drama Our Blues, Suga produced and featured in That That with PSY, Suga and Jungkook came out with Stay Alive, and Jungkook treated fans to My You. The collaborations continued with Jungkook and Charlie Puth's Left and Right, J-Hope and Crush's Rush Hour, and Jin and Coldplay's Astronaut. While J-Hope released his first album Jack in the Box and performed at the Lollapalooza, RM too unveiled his first album Indigo. Jungkook became the first Asian artist to perform at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar.","This year included several firsts for BTS, making them big moments for the group.

It was significant as it was the first time BTS had a concert with an in-person audience in the city in two and a half years. BTS next held their Permission to Dance On Stage concert in Las Vegas in April. The first concert came just days ahead of their performance at the Grammys. BTS also held its first free concert in Busan in October. For this show, BTS appeared 'without any additional fee' and HYBE invested their personal funds for the concert. 2) BTS members at Grammy's: The seven members performed at the 64th Grammy Awards in April, their first in-person performance for which they received a standing ovation. Just ahead of the show, BTS members contracted Covid-19 and Jin could partially perform due to his surgery. The performance saw the members pulling off a museum heist on their single Butter. 3) BTS 'on a break': Fans were left shocked and heartbroken when during the Festa dinner the group announced a 'hiatus'. Suga had said in a video during the dinner as per the English subtitles, “So we’ve entered an off-season. We’re going into a hiatus now.” He later added, “It’s not like we’re disbanding. We should live doing what we want to do...Writing lyrics is the hardest. What message do we want to give? Nothing comes out anymore."" Later, AP quoted BigHit's clarification, “BTS are not taking a hiatus. Members will be focusing more on solo projects at this time."" RM and Jungkook also issued clarifications that they will not go on a hiatus. 4) BTS album Proof: The group released their anthology album Proof in June. The album is a 3-CD collection of BTS’ hit old as well as new songs. Proof included three new songs--Yet to Come, Run BTS, and Born Singer. Their old hits I Need You, Run, Fire, Fake Love, Persona, Moon, are also part of the album. It released a few days before their ninth debut anniversary, on June 10. 5) BTS at the White House: The group attended the White House Press briefing in May to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes. They made history as they had a private meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House for the first time ever. They were invited to the White House in celebration of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders Heritage Month (AANHPI Heritage Month). The US President surprised the members by playing Butter in the Oval Office before their discussion to make them 'feel at home'. 6) BTS military enlistment: South Korea has a rule of mandatory military service for able-bodied men by 28. K-pop stars are granted the ability to defer their enrolment until 30. BTS ARMY has always dreaded the time when the members will have to spend months in the military. This year, in October, BigHit Music announced that military enlistment will begin with the eldest member Jin. The group will reconvene in 2025. Though fans wished them well, the news left them emotional. Apart from these, BTS also made a comeback with their variety show, RUN BTS, after 10 months. Fans saw the members doing solo projects with Jimin singing With You for K-drama Our Blues, Suga produced and featured in That That with PSY, Suga and Jungkook came out with Stay Alive, and Jungkook treated fans to My You. The collaborations continued with Jungkook and Charlie Puth's Left and Right, J-Hope and Crush's Rush Hour, and Jin and Coldplay's Astronaut. While J-Hope released his first album Jack in the Box and performed at the Lollapalooza, RM too unveiled his first album Indigo. Jungkook became the first Asian artist to perform at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar.","['All the other members--RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V aka Kim Taehyung and Jungkook will follow him.']",0.9767441860465116,0.0,0.005656108597285148,0.0018228748623625446,0.05128205128205128

31,"K-pop is spreading &ldquo;smooth like butter&rdquo; all over the globe, and no one is safe from its &lsquo;Pink Venom&rsquo;  The industry is showing no sign of &lsquo;Shut Down&rsquo; anytime soon  K-pop fever is taking over the world &nbsp;

What is K-pop

K-pop actually means Korean Popular music  It is a mix and match of many genres that includes, but is not limited to, pop, rock, hip-hop, R&amp;B, etc  What makes K-pop so unique is that the artists are not limited to one genre  K-pop is really experimental  K-pop groups usually have at least one rapper in them, be it BLACKPINK or BTS  Also, the K-pop language is not strictly limited to Korean  Many languages are mixed and matched in songs, such as in the case of groups like MAMAMOO or SEVENTEEN where English phrases are increasingly being used  This got them brownie points in the global market further increasing their chances of going global &nbsp;

Global K-pop-ularity

According to Korea JoongAng Daily, when it comes to the sudden global K-pop fever, timing is the main key  They trace it back to Spotify&rsquo;s decision to launch the K-pop Hub, but that played a minor role compared to social media and algorithms  And while they report it as mainly a timing thing, the K-pop industry had been laying the bricks of the foundation for its rise for a long time  They always wanted to enter the foreign market  From concerts and events abroad to including more and more English hooks in their songs, the rise can be best described as a domino effect 

As a result, Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines surpassed South Korea in K-pop related tweets as revealed by Twitter last year &nbsp;&nbsp;

So, now that we have our basics right, let&rsquo;s look at the top 10 new K-pop groups that you need to check out, like, right NOW &nbsp;

2  (G)I-DLE

Special mention:

41,"BTS’ oldest member Jin went solo after J-Hope and made his official debut with a single album. The Astronaut has been meaningful for multiple reasons for the group as well as the fans who have welcomed the release with warm words and moist eyes.

Music charts
The song which came as a result of Jin working with Coldplay for the second time following ‘My Universe’, debuted on the Billboard Hot100 chart at No. 51. He also tied with PSY for a record on United Kingdom’s Official Official Singles Chart for grabbing the 61st spot in the week after its release. His latest achievement comes with selling 1,024,382 copies of The Astronaut according to the numbers released by Circle Chart (earlier known as Gaon Chart).

Third million-seller
The BTS member is only the third soloist in the history of the music chart to have recorded over a million copies sold of his album. Jin follows EXO member Baekhyun and trot-ballad singer Lim Young Woong on the list. Becoming a million seller is a massive feat for the BTS member who is expected to enlist for his mandatory military service soon.

Jin’s military service
The group’s national duty which had become a global discussion received an update as their agency announced the member’s decision to enlist. Jin became the first member to apply for the cancellation of his delay notice and will possibly enlist before his upcoming 30th birthday on December 4. He will also possibly be at the front line for his basic military training according to his reply to a fan on Weverse recently.

BLACKPINK lip-synced at the MTV VMAs 2022, alleges Variety

In a recent article, listing &quot;The Best and Worst Moments of the 2022 MTV VMAs&quot;, Variety author Thania Garcia put BLACKPINK and a couple of other artists who performed at the awards show under scrutiny, calling them &quot;repeat offenders &quot; The magazine stated that although BLACKPINK members &quot;devoted attention to their killer dance routines&quot;, they lip-synced their songs 

Even though the author pointed out the &quot;tricky&quot; business and the amount of hard work that goes into the award shows, fans were outraged by the magazine&#39;s allegations  While some of them went on to criticize Variety for spreading misinformation, BLINK (BLACKPINK fandom) members, which is one of the most popular fan groups in the industry, straight up stated that the magazine is doing it for clickbait and knows how the fans will react 

Many fans rose to defend their favorite K-pop band BLACKPINK, pointing out that the members, Jisoo, Ros&eacute;, Jennie, and Lisa, did not lip-sync their performance  The fans stated that they could hear the band members hitting their mics and breathing onto them  Several BLINK members also took their opinions and complains to the article&#39;s comments section, bashing the publication for their allegations 

Now, it is true that BLACKPINK used AR (All-Recorded), which is commonly used in award shows to enhance the live performances of artists  However, it is not synonymous with lip-syncing  It is essentially pre-recorded back vocals and music that plays in the background 

Following this, many pointed out that Brazilian singer Anitta and rapper Flo Milli, other artists who were listed by Variety, also did not lip-sync  In fact, many outraged individuals took to Twitter to demand an apology from Variety for falsely accusing BLACKPINK and the other artists of lip-syncing

56,"BHUBANESWAR: Shreya Lenka, 18, from Odisha’s Jharsuguda wanted to be a dancer since her childhood. She participated in dance competitions and took lessons in Hindustani classical music to hone her skills. Lenka got a big break when she was selected for six-month training in Seoul to become a member of the Korean pop (K-Pop) band Blackswan. She has been in Seoul since December undergoing singing and dancing practice for hours under the trainers of music company DR Music Entertainment. Blackswan was started by the company as Rania in 2011. It later became BP Rania before getting its current name in October 2020. After its oldest member Hyeme left the group in November 2020, DR Music in May last year announced global auditions to replace her. Lenka, a Korean pop fan, applied for the online audition and was among the 23 shortlisted out of 4,000 applicants from across the world in July. The selections were made after their recorded videos were assessed by the DR Music. Four including Lenka were chosen for the final round for which they had to travel to Seoul for training for one of them would be chosen to replace Hyeme. Two of the four opted out leaving Lenka and Brazil’s Gabriela Dalcin as the final contestants. Lenka’s cousin, Sonali, said in the second round, she had to either dance or do a rap of the song Tonight from the Goodbye Rania album of the group in front of the camera. “She had to dance without any background music and do a rap on the song. A couple of weeks after we uploaded the unedited video of her performance on Google Drive, the company made an announcement on its YouTube channel about her selection,” said Sonali. She added Lenka had already given audition in several other Korean companies and they hoped she will make it. K-pop or Korean pop started out in South Korea in 1990s that included different musical genres such as rock, hip hop and electronic music. As the East Asian country experienced an economic boom in 90s bringing bigger purchasing power among the country’s youth, they gained easier access to American popular culture and artists. As per moonROK, a K-pop news portal, the foundation of K-pop was laid in 1992 with an electric hip-hop TV performance by Seo Taiji and Boys. Soon K-pop began spreading in non Asian countries like USA and some European countries. As per Koreaboo.com, the daily schedule of a K-pop trainee like Shreya is packed with classes that range from the standard vocal, rap, dance lessons to personal training, language, and musical instruments. Former K-pop idol Minu from the band Boyfriend in her Instagram post revealed that trainees go to the music company as early as 10 am and stay as late as midnight. Lenka’s father Avinash Lenka, who works in a private company in Jharsuguda, encouraged her to follow her passion for dancing. “From her childhood, she always wanted to be a dancer and participated in several dance competitions,” said her mother Priyatama. She added whether her daughter is finally chosen as the fifth member of Blackswan or not is another matter. “But she is focussed on learning Korean language and K-pop music.” Priyatama said her daughter was always focussed. “During school days, she used to head for dance training after reaching home at 2.30 pm and would not come back before 9 pm. I too wanted to pursue dancing but could not fulfil the dream as my father did not approve of it. I do not know if my daughter would become the first K-pop idol from India, but I am happy that she is living her dream.” In a statement, DR Music said Lenka and Dalcin were undergoing basic practice and Korean language education. “They will go through...six months of training. It is the final audition. We have prepared to prove through the training process that they themselves are eligible to debut as K-pop artists. Therefore, we will evaluate whether they have the basic skills to perform as a K-pop artist, such as their personality and qualities...” Sonali said her cousin’s schedule is hectic. By the time she returns to her room, she is completely exhausted. “We have formed a family WhatsApp group in which she sometimes chats. But the conversations are very brief.”","BHUBANESWAR: Shreya Lenka, 18, from Odisha’s Jharsuguda wanted to be a dancer since her childhood. She participated in dance competitions and took lessons in Hindustani classical music to hone her skills. Lenka got a big break when she was selected for six-month training in Seoul to become a member of the Korean pop (K-Pop) band Blackswan. She has been in Seoul since December undergoing singing and dancing practice for hours under the trainers of music company DR Music Entertainment. Blackswan was started by the company as Rania in 2011. It later became BP Rania before getting its current name in October 2020. After its oldest member Hyeme left the group in November 2020, DR Music in May last year announced global auditions to replace her. Lenka, a Korean pop fan, applied for the online audition and was among the 23 shortlisted out of 4,000 applicants from across the world in July. The selections were made after their recorded videos were assessed by the DR Music. Four including Lenka were chosen for the final round for which they had to travel to Seoul for training for one of them would be chosen to replace Hyeme. Lenka’s cousin, Sonali, said in the second round, she had to either dance or do a rap of the song Tonight from the Goodbye Rania album of the group in front of the camera. “She had to dance without any background music and do a rap on the song. A couple of weeks after we uploaded the unedited video of her performance on Google Drive, the company made an announcement on its YouTube channel about her selection,” said Sonali. She added Lenka had already given audition in several other Korean companies and they hoped she will make it. K-pop or Korean pop started out in South Korea in 1990s that included different musical genres such as rock, hip hop and electronic music. As the East Asian country experienced an economic boom in 90s bringing bigger purchasing power among the country’s youth, they gained easier access to American popular culture and artists. As per moonROK, a K-pop news portal, the foundation of K-pop was laid in 1992 with an electric hip-hop TV performance by Seo Taiji and Boys. Soon K-pop began spreading in non Asian countries like USA and some European countries. As per Koreaboo.com, the daily schedule of a K-pop trainee like Shreya is packed with classes that range from the standard vocal, rap, dance lessons to personal training, language, and musical instruments. Former K-pop idol Minu from the band Boyfriend in her Instagram post revealed that trainees go to the music company as early as 10 am and stay as late as midnight. Lenka’s father Avinash Lenka, who works in a private company in Jharsuguda, encouraged her to follow her passion for dancing. “From her childhood, she always wanted to be a dancer and participated in several dance competitions,” said her mother Priyatama. She added whether her daughter is finally chosen as the fifth member of Blackswan or not is another matter. “But she is focussed on learning Korean language and K-pop music.” Priyatama said her daughter was always focussed. “During school days, she used to head for dance training after reaching home at 2.30 pm and would not come back before 9 pm.

OMG:

This song expresses NewJeans&#39; unique and trendy tone in various styles, and it is expected that you will be able to feel another personality and charm of NewJeans  It is also expected to present a completely different feeling from the debut album &#39;NewJeans&#39; released last summer  NewJeans is one of the representative 4th generation girl groups that made the second half of 2022 hot with their debut  In a short period of time, not only did all of the triple title songs such as &#39;Attention&#39;, &#39;Cookie&#39; and &#39;Hype Boy&#39; become hits, but also led to the cover dance craze, winning both the Rookie Award and the Grand Prize at the year-end awards ceremony  He boasted an unrivaled presence and charm 

NewJeans&#39; achievement:

In particular, it showed the &#39;retro&#39; concept properly  With styling and cover images reminiscent of the 1990s and early 2000s, they instantly caught the eye, establishing themselves as a girl group with a unique concept  Here, while focusing on the narrative of &#39;relationship&#39;, the music video with an interesting story received a lot of attention  The chorus that is easy to sing along with the lyrics that resonate with, the addictive melody, and the attractive choreography were also points  As a result, content such as challenges, cover songs, and cover dances naturally increased &nbsp;

Ditto:

The pre-released song &#39;Ditto&#39; attracted attention as soon as it was released with Park Ji Hu and Choi Hyun Wook&#39;s appearances and the retro sensibility of the video  In this way, New Jeans has already captured not only the topic but also the music charts in a short period of time  If last summer was refreshing NewJeans, this hip-hop R&amp;B &#39;OMG&#39; is expected to show a hip yet dreamy NewJeans 

NewJeans:

The strengths of NewJeans, such as the retro concept to believe in and watch, the narrative music video that is tightly packed with the keyword &#39;relationship&#39;, the content that makes you more immersed, the beautiful visuals of the members, the ability to blend these concepts perfectly, and the addictive yet attractive song  The number of pre-orders for NewJeans&#39; &#39;OMG&#39; this time exceeded 800,000 copies, surpassing the pre-order amount of the debut album and the total sales volume  The pre-released song &#39;Ditto&#39; took first place on various music charts upon its release, and is still receiving a lot of love 
_ZAgIHmHLdcHere are five reasons why this song and MV had us gripping our seats:-&nbsp;

Song

The title song &#39;OMG&#39;, which was released following the pre-release song released at the end of the year, is a bouncy and exciting hip-hop R&amp;B song that mixes UK garage rhythm and trap rhythm based on hip-hop drum source and percussion  In particular, the fact that the song was conceived during the production of the debut album also arouses interest  Member Hanni participated in writing the lyrics, and one can feel another charm of NewJeans by expressing their unique and trendy tone in various styles 

Concept&nbsp;

NewJeans have made a name for themselves from their debut time as one of the most unique K-Pop groups to exist as they break the stereotypes and the mold presented to them by the predecessors and rather, pave a new way of creating music as well as the MV  The MV is set in a mental facility where the five members express their issues and who they see themselves as  While it can seem quirky and funny, it is actually an inside view on how intense feelings can alter you as a person &nbsp;

The members&nbsp;

In the MV, each member has a different problem  Hanni thinks she is Siri, iPhone&rsquo;s built-in, voice controlled personal assistant, Danielle was found laughing at a TV with static but she is actually the person who thinks they are being controlled and tries to make the members remember that they are, in fact, NewJeans  It seems like Hyein has &lsquo;main character syndrome&rsquo; where she takes the role of the main character in her favorite fairy tales like Cinderella, Matchstick girl and Snow White while Haerin thinks she is a cat and is seen in many scenes, behaving like one  But the most twisted one is Minji&rsquo;s, who pretends to be a doctor taking all the other members to the facility while she, herself, suffers through issues &nbsp;

The message&nbsp;

The song talks about being lovesick and how those intense feelings make one go crazy and that is what shows in the MV as well  The idea of being meta in the MV also adds a nice flair to it  The idea of being in a relationship and expressing the struggles of being in one in this day and age is amazingly executed &nbsp;

References&nbsp;

The MV is packed with references  First, the choreography for OMG was initially shown to the viewers in Ditto and other scenes from that MV also makes its way like the gray cat represents Haerin  Kim Joo Hun of Big Mouth fame makes an appearance as the doctor who eventually becomes overwhelmed with all the stories he heard but the end scene is truly the cherry on top when a girl is shown writing hate comments about NewJeans and Minji appears as the doctor, taking her away &nbsp;

SUGA

Just as the reports were coming in about Jin&rsquo;s enlistment day as he entered the military training base at the Yeoncheon County of Gyeonggi Province, it was reported by Korean media outlets that member SUGA would follow next  As the second oldest in the group, many have already become curious about his possible date, location and other details  While Jin enlisted as an active duty soldier, as confirmed by his agency BIGHIT MUSIC, according to reports SUGA is likely to be a public service worker  This may be the case due to the surgery he had on his shoulder in November 2020 

Agency&rsquo;s response

Replying to the reports, BIGHIT MUSIC which manages BTS and its artists, said that it is difficult to confirm anything regarding SUGA&rsquo;s enlistment at the moment  They further added that the company and the members, both hope BTS can promote as a full group in 2025  This follows up with what was previously said by the company regarding the whole group conveying in 2025 with their military services completed  However, this also means that the other members will soon go for their own military duty 

Jin&rsquo;s enlistment

BTS&rsquo; Jin entered his training base camp surrounded in the presence of reporters and a few fans of the group  Earlier, Jin had asked the BTS ARMY to not arrive at the enlistment centre in order to avoid any dangerous crowding situations  It was also reported that the other six members- RM, SUGA, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook accompanied Jin to the boot camp

Stray Kids&rsquo; Hyunjin

Known as one of the visuals and dancers of Stray Kids, Hyunjin has always been loved for his talents but beyond that, he is a caring individual who works hard to be a rock for other members in any way and is empathetic  He is a funny guy who entertains others but at the same time, he spends time caring for others and the environment around him, like a typical INFP&nbsp;

SEVENTEEN&rsquo;s DK, S Coups, Jun and Hoshi&nbsp;

This group has the most amount of INFPs, which is a rare occurrence since INFPs are imaginative but aren&rsquo;t as entertaining as other personality types  DK is a talented vocalist and is known to be an emotional person who always takes care of his members in any way he can  S Coups, being the leader, is known to be fiercely protective of his members and fights anyone who wrongs them  Being the oldest, he acts as a father figure to them and it shows in whatever he does  Jun is a quiet one and represents every INFP who has big ideas but cannot express them well while Hoshi seems extremely social onscreen, he is actually reserved and quiet offscreen and rather keeps to himself during his time off &nbsp;

Red Velvet&rsquo;s Yeri and Joy

The maknae of the group, Yeri is known to be cheeky and is always seen making fun of her &lsquo;unnies&rsquo; in the best way and they let her because she is the youngest  Besides her wit, she is an imaginative person and stands by her values at any given time  She isn&rsquo;t quiet but she is good at tightening her lip in certain situations  Joy is known for her pretty smile and amazing visuals  She is usually quiet but her bright personality radiates off her wherever she goes &nbsp;

BLACKPINK&rsquo;s Jennie&nbsp;

One of the most popular K-Pop idols in the world, Jennie did not lose her personality in the midst of it all, remaining mysterious and caring towards her members and other friends  Her true personality comes alive only around people she trusts but at the same time, she uses creative sensibility in her work, which shines through &nbsp;

ATEEZ&rsquo;s Hongjoong and San&nbsp;

While all of ATEEZ members seem like extroverted people, Hongjoong and San have been identified as INFP and it seems to suit them  Hongjoong, being a leader and producer of the group, is extremely creative, caring and protective towards his members while San is imaginative and is the right person to have a deep conversation with &nbsp;

NCT DREAM&rsquo;s Chenle&nbsp;

Chenle is the sassy vocalist of NCT DREAM and while he seems extroverted, he is actually introverted and often has troubles opening up about his troubles to his members, they have complained about that often  Being attached to music, he is creative and enjoys music in all forms  Despite his issue with opening up, he still maintains his likability and many members in NCT love his personality &nbsp;

IU&nbsp;

A celebrated soloist and actress, IU is undoubtedly one of the most popular public figures of South Korea  She is known to be quiet, reserved and usually keeps to herself which is different from how she portrays herself in her MVs and the characters she takes on  Despite being quiet, she is loved for her personality and empathy she constantly shows towards her fans and staff &nbsp;

Oh My Girl&rsquo;s Arin&nbsp;

A visual, talented actress and a great variety show personality, Arin is also seen as a reserved and quiet member of Oh My Girl but she is also seen as a caring individual who tries to keep everyone happy around her  She also has difficulty opening up to others and she has a true personality she shows only to the people closest to her 

THE BOYZ&rsquo;s Kevin, Jacob, Younghoon and New&nbsp;

The reserved quartet of THE BOYZ- Kevin, Jacob, Younghoon and New have a similar kind of personality where they seem more reserved and quiet but are actually fun, quirky and social in certain situations  They are talented, sweet and extremely empathetic  They are always seen to care for others

I knew it wouldn't be easy. I was practising for the concert."" At one point during their practice, Suga got curious and asked the choreographer, ""Are you a leftie? We normally start with the right hand. You started everything with the left hand. So I thought you were a leftie."" As the video continued, Suga practised and said, ""If I think about something else for a moment. I miss it."" One of the choreographers again told Suga that 'he's learning fast'. The rapper laughed and said, ""I'm an idol after all,"" to which they all laughed and agreed. Suga also practised with PSY and the entire team of That That. During their break, Suga asked PSY, ""Don't you shoot part by part?"" PSY replied, ""You don't think I have the stamina?"" As PSY teased Suga, the latter laughed. As the video ended, Suga said, ""It's harder than our recent choreography. I'm so exhausted. The choreography I didn't think it'd be this hard. I should do well tomorrow."" Suga, PSY and their team seemingly filmed the music video of That That the next day. That That celebrates the end of the Covid-19 pandemic, and things going back to normal. In the song, both Suga and PSY featured in cowboy outfits in the middle of a desert. That That is part of PSY's latest album PSY 9th.

If I had to name one thing that I learned from you then that would be ""kindness"".

From encouraging us to be proud of the little demon that resides within us to comforting us by saying it's okay to cry and let it out to giving tips on how to deal with stress and anxiety, you've truly been a Guardian angel for us Stays. Honestly, I could go on talking about how much your kindness has given me the strength to endure these hard times, not just me but Stays and every other person who looks up to you.

Losing weight: The rapper spoke about losing weight during their variety show Run BTS. Suga said, ""It looks like I lost weight? Yes, I lost like three-four kilos. During Run BTS, I lost like four kilos or so."" On his glasses: While reading comments, Suga said, ""My eyes have gotten a bit bad lately (wore glasses). I changed my glasses recently. They broke in the case after I got home from Las Vegas so I changed them to a lighter one so I could comfortably wear them. Yeah, I do wear these for working since my eyesight has gotten bad probably from staring at a monitor for so long in a dark environment."" PSY concert: Suga said, ""It was fun…It’s different to be at another artist’s concert but it’s only one minute and a half. The people there must’ve been surprised since there was no advance notice."" When a fan enquired about the bruises on his arms, Suga revealed, ""I got an IV. Not because I am sick or anything. I occasionally get IVs.""

I really had no thought of getting a tattoo for my whole life but got it since the members got one. I didn’t have confidence knowing my personality-- to not regret it, not get sick of it or like want to move it a bit to the side or something…But I don’t have any wish to get more. No more talking about the friendship tattoo."" His hair: When a fan asked about his long hair, Suga replied, ""You keep talking about my hair length. My hair has grown so much. I have a pin that’s holding my front hair back but my hair has grown to here (points to chin).
